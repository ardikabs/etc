# As a starter script in our CI/CD box, we need to set apart between the box and the scripts
# As seen on the below example, there is 2 use case for CI/CD using GitlabCI and CI/CD with GitHub repository as scm
# Both use case provide the convention which `/bin/*` directory stored the scripts either a script or a binary
# and `shared/*` directory stored shared file that could be used for other script

# 1. Example use case for CI/CD using GitlabCI, utilize GitlabCI artifact

   ðŸ“Ž Hey there! It looks like an error occurs when trying to download the scripts.

   It is probably an issue either from GitLab or the job is completely missing or unknown.

   Please contact the administrator (@team) for further details.
